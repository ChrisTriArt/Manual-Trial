# Troubleshooting and Frequently Asked Questions (Launcher)

## Q1. I want to use MIIDEL on a 32-bit computer.

A. MIIDEL has been a 64-bit only system since version 5, so please use it in a 64-bit environment.

## Q2. I was able to use MIIDEL until recently, but suddenly I can’t log in. What should I do?

A. Please delete the folder at “C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Miidel8”. Performing this operation will also delete the license information, so you will need to re-enter your license information. Please prepare the correct license information before proceeding.

## Q13. I received a message saying the offline usage period has expired. What should I do?

A. MIIDEL needs to check the license status while online. We apologize for the inconvenience, but please register again while online.

## Q14. I am getting an "Exceeded maximum usage limit" error while using MIIDEL. How should I handle this?

A. If MIIDEL did not close properly while being used, the usage state may continue for 30 minutes. Therefore, this message may appear even when there are no other users. We kindly ask you to check the number of currently active and running users again, and then attempt the operation once more.

## Q15. I don't know what to enter for the address and port. Can you please help me?

A. This is where you should enter the address and port number of the proxy server that your company is using. Additionally, you may need to enter user authentication information for the proxy server, if necessary. Furthermore, access to api.miidel.com will also be required. Please confirm the specific input details and whether access to api.miidel.com is permitted with your system administrator.

## Q16. After changing the proxy server settings, MIIDEL shows as offline despite being online, and the communication test fails. How should I address this?

A. First, please check the settings you configured in MIIDEL. If that does not resolve the issue, please delete the folder at “C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Miidel8”. However, please note that performing this operation will also delete the license information, so you will need to re-enter your license information. Please prepare the correct license information before proceeding.

## Q17. What should I do regarding license transfer when I update MIIDEL or change my computer?

A. When transferring a license, you can deactivate it on your old computer and then install MIIDEL anew on your new computer to register it. Depending on the version of MIIDEL, it may not automatically transfer the license. Specifically, direct transfers from MIIDEL5 to 6 or from MIIDEL5 to 7 are not possible. However, automatic transfer from MIIDEL6 to 7 is possible. For floating licenses, after deactivating the corresponding license from the management panel, you can register the license on the new computer to use it again.
